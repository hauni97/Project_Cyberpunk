## Legal Notice

This tool is designed **exclusively for authorized security assessments, red team operations, and legitimate security research**. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test is **illegal**.

Users are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

## Executive Summary

A mobile, voice-controlled penetration testing system that enables discreet reconnaissance, analysis, and exploitation. Through the combination of AR smartglasses, Kali NetHunter, and AI-powered voice processing, a hands-free OSINT and Red Team tool for professional security audits is created.

## Use Case

Concept Idea
The idea of PROJECT CYBERPUNK is to connect various hardware components and state-of-the-art software into a modern concept.
Hardware Components:

High-performance smartphone
Smartglasses with camera and Directional Audio (Open-Ear Audio without third parties being able to hear)
High-performance WiFi antenna with monitoring and injection capabilities
GPS antenna (integrated in smartglasses or smartphone)
Powerbank for extended operations
Kali NetHunter on the smartphone (rooted)
ShellGPT as intelligent command interface

Functional Principle
All mentioned components are interconnected and can be controlled via voice commands, similar to Siri or Bixby, but optimized for professional security assessments.
The smartglasses provide the microphone for voice input and the speakers for discreet audio output that is only audible to the wearer. The integrated camera is used to create photos and video recordings that are simultaneously linked with geolocation through GPS. Additionally, further information from other tools can be embedded into the metadata.
In parallel, networks can be scanned and EMI signals captured via the external WiFi antenna. If the smartglasses have a HUD, results can be displayed there in addition to voice output. OSINT searches can also be performed via voice command through the internet function of the smartglasses or smartphone.
Natural Language Interface
A critical aspect is the interpreter/translator for voice input. To avoid shouting shell codes in public, the system translates natural conversation into technical commands.
As a wake word, "Operator" still sounds relatively technical, but "Hello Dad" sounds like a normal phone call. The goal is for the conversation with the software to sound like a normal phone conversation, which the system then translates into shell code.
Translation Examples:
Natural Language → Technical Command:

"Take a look at the surroundings" → Start WiFi scan + capture photo with geotagging
"Who actually works here?" → OSINT query on LinkedIn/XING based on GPS location
"Interesting architecture, that building" → Video capture with automatic metadata enrichment
"Can you tell me who owns this?" → Whois lookup + property registry research
"How secure is this actually?" → Vulnerability scan on discovered systems
"Tell me more about it" → ShellGPT analyzes collected data and provides context summary

The system recognizes the context and translates the conversation into corresponding technical commands, while it sounds like a normal phone conversation to bystanders.
The Result
The use case enables a low-key environmental scan. No typing on phone or laptop. No obvious photography. Simply a guy standing there, enjoying the view and talking on the phone.
A completely normal scene for bystanders. In reality, complete multi-modal intelligence gathering with automatic georeferencing and comprehensive metadata enrichment of all captured data is running in the background.
